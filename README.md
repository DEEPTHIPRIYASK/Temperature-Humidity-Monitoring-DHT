This project utilizes a **DHT11** sensor to monitor real-time temperature and humidity. The design and simulation are implemented using **Proteus software**, offering a practical solution for environmental monitoring in applications such as smart homes, greenhouses, and industrial setups.

## Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity data collection.
- DHT sensor interfacing with Arduino UNO.
- Designed and simulated in **Proteus**.
- User-friendly data visualization.

## Requirements
- **DHT11** Sensor
- Microcontroller - Arduino UNO
- **Proteus** software for circuit design and simulation
- Resistors, wires, and breadboard (for physical implementation)
